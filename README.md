# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Acel Suriaga. I am a Computer Science major at Florida Atlantic University.
My minor is in Artificial Intelligence. I want to be a Full Stack Developer.
I want to either work for a large company or maybe a startup and then eventually freelance making websites and apps for local businesses and private clients.
